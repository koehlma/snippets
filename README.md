About
=====
Some code snippets in various programming languages I wrote and don't became a
project.
Just some experiments or stuff came into my mind and I want to try.
Normally not active development and no documentation here.

HTML
====
[Periodic Table](http://koehlma.github.com/snippets/html/periodictable.html):
A Periodic Table with some special effects based only on HTML and CSS3.

JavaScript
==========
[Chroma-Key](https://github.com/koehlma/snippets/blob/master/javascript/chroma-key.js):
A JavaScript based Chroma-Key for HTML5-canvas.
This actually does it's job, but sometimes it is very slow.
For serious chroma-keying with JavaScript I would recommend [Seriously.js](https://github.com/brianchirls/Seriously.js).
